Enforce lightness monotonicity
- dynamically update min/max values to match prev+1 and next-1

Area on the right: (for selected point)
- Range slider for lightness, bounded by prev and next point
- 2D control for other dimensions

Support for non-monotonic colormaps
- One curve (set of control points)
- Multiple segments: each segment is monotonic
- Breakpoints have an associated value, so that value -> lightness becomes value -> segment -> lightness
