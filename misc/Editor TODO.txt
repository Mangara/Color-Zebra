Area on the right: (for selected point)
- Background of lightness slider shows colors
- 2D control for other dimensions

Support for non-monotonic colormaps
- One curve (set of control points)
- Multiple segments: each segment is monotonic
- Breakpoints have an associated value, so that value -> lightness becomes value -> segment -> lightness
- Button to break a colormap: reverses lightness monotonicity
