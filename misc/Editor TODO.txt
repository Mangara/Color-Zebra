Import colormap functionality?
- Given color points and order, fit spline to this
- Points define a curve in LAB space
- Preprocess this to get a curve with monotonic lightness: longest increasing subsequence?
- Have a method that, given the points and a number of control points, finds the best quadratic spline to approximate these points
- Binary search for the spline with the smallest number of control points that has reasonable error

Upgrade to better color space than CIELAB?
- matplotlib likes CAM02-UCS

Support for non-monotonic colormaps
- One curve (set of control points)
- Multiple segments: each segment is monotonic
- Breakpoints have an associated value, so that value -> lightness becomes value -> segment -> lightness
- Button to break a colormap: reverses lightness monotonicity
